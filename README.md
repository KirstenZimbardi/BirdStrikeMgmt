# BirdStrikeMgmt
Animated geospatial time series showing changes in bird mass during 10+ years of environmental management.
Several government and private clients contributed to the environmental management projects, covering much of the area surrounding the airport. 

The animation helps clients to see the benefits through: 
  1. substantial, and sustained reductions in bird mass at their sites
  2. bird strike rates at the airport that are significantly lower than comparably sized airports - including several 'strike-free' years
    

By putting this data on maps, and animating the changes over time using colour and size, this animation helped in retaining current clients, and in supporting proposals to new clients in the area.
Further, benchmarking bird strike rates with comparable airports made a compelling addition to proposals to new clients from other airports and their neighbouring land-holders.

**Free your data from your spreadsheets and tables - help your clients see your message in time, space and colour!**

The live animation is hosted on a shinyapps.io server at: https://kirstenz.shinyapps.io/BirdStrikeMgmt/
